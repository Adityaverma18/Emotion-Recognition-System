# Emotion Recognition System using CNN and Keras

This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with Keras and deployed using OpenCV. It detects human emotions from webcam video frames and classifies them into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

## 🧠 Features

- CNN model trained on grayscale 48x48 facial images
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascades
- Emotion classification using trained `.keras` or `.h5` model
- Visualization and evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix)
